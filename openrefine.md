## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:
- Identify and clean up errors en masse in a large dataset
- Sort and filter large amounts of data
- Save a dataset in a new format

## What You Need
- Computer with an internet browser and internet connection
- A dataset - ideally something on the larger size (i.e. tens or hundreds of thousands of data points)
    - This can be uploaded as a file in many different formats (csv, json, wiki, xls, etc.), from a webpage, or even via copy/paste as text

## About OpenRefine

OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data. 

## Get Started

OpenRefine is an app that is downloaded to your personal computer that then uses your internet browser to interact with it. While it might look as though you are uploading your data to the internet through your browser, the data is in fact still being locally hosted on your hard drive. 

To get started, there is no account sign up! All you need to do is visit **[this page](https://openrefine.org/download.html)** and pick the download kit that is applicable to your operating system. 

_NOTE_: If using a Mac, you may get a security warning that your computer doesn’t recognize the developer and won’t let you open the application. If that is the case, then go to your System Settings > Security & Privacy > Click the _“Open Anyway”_ button in the _“Allow apps downloaded from”_ section of your General Settings.

Once you have the app downloaded and installed, simply launch the app, upload your data, and start working! As a reminder, when you launch the OpenRefine app, your default internet browser will open. This is how you interact with the application even though your data is still being hosted locally on your personal drive. So no need to worry about the security of your data!
