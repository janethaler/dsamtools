### [Distant Reader](distantreader.md)
The Distant Reader is a web-based text analysis toolset for “reading” and analyzing texts. It takes unstructured data (text) as input, and it outputs sets of structured data for analysis. The Distant Reader is intended to supplement the traditional reading process by simplifying the process of identifying trends and anomalies in large volumes of text.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
* Identify the types of problems the Distant Reader addresses
* Submit content to the Distant Reader and download results
* Compare some methods for interpreting your downloaded results

### [OpenRefine](openrefine.md)
OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a powerful, opensource tool for working with messy data. Key features include cleaning up small to large mistakes en masse, converting data from one format to another, and adding to a dataset by pulling data from an online source into your dataset.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
* Use Facets to clean up messy data
* Filter and export a specific portion of your dataset
